Here's a summary of what I've learned by building my to-do list with local storage:

Key Learnings from Building a To-Do List with Local Storage:

React State Management:
I've gained practical experience with useState to manage the application's data, including tasks, modal states, and editing states.
Understanding how state updates trigger re-renders and how to correctly update state using functional updates (setTasks(prevTasks => ...)).


Component Lifecycle with useEffect:
I've learned how to use useEffect to perform side effects, specifically:
Loading data from local storage on component mount.
Saving data to local storage whenever the task list changes.
I've practiced using dependency arrays to control when useEffect runs.


Local Storage for Data Persistence:
I've implemented client-side data persistence using localStorage.
I've learned how to serialize and deserialize data using JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse().
I understood that Local storage persists after page refresh, and is shared between tabs of the same origin.


Handling User Interactions:
I've implemented event handlers (onClick, onSubmit, onChange) to respond to user actions like adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed.
I have learned to use conditional rendering to show different UI elements based on the application state.


Array Manipulation:
I've practiced using array methods like map, filter, and spread syntax (...) to update and manipulate the task list.


Modal Implementation:
I have learned how to implement a modal window, and manage its open and close states.


Debugging Techniques:
I've used console.log statements and browser developer tools to debug issues with state updates, local storage, and component rendering.
I have learned to use try catch blocks to catch potential json parsing errors.


Importance of Unique IDs:
I have learned the importance of unique ID's, and how duplicate ID's can cause unexpected behaviors.

Overall Application Flow:
I have gained a better understanding of how data flows through a React application, from user input to state updates, and finally to the UI and local storage.

In essence, I've built a functional application that demonstrates core React concepts and client-side data persistence. This experience has provided you with valuable skills for building more complex web applications.
